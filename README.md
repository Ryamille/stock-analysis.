# Refactoring with VBA

## Overview of the project

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create new module and refactor our oringial module. The original module allowed Steve to see the data set of 2017 and 2018 by using the button macro. The new module will be edit the VBA code to perform faster.

## Results
From the data there is almost a night and day difference between the two results. In 2017 the data shows that only TERP stock had a negative percentage value. Were as 2018 had ENPH and Run as the only stocks with a positive percentage value.
By editing the original code I was able to get code to run and get all the data about 0.6 seconds faster than my original code. There were sometimes I would even get faster results.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
### Advantages
I would say the most noticable advantage for refactoring is the fact that it makes the run time that much faster. Especially with a lot of data that you would need to switch back and forth between just makes the job quicker. The other advantage would be that code is formatted to look much cleaner with everything all together. Before I had two modules doing the same thing this one new module does. This will make it easy if someone else would want to add anything to the existing code.

### Disadvantages
The only downside I would ever see from refactoring code would be the human error involed in rewriting the code. I notice when I reapplied the same formula agian I was receiving many errors allowing me not run my new code. The only solution I was able to fix this with was by adding (12) in the arrays section and (i) for my loops. This was somehow not needed in my original code to be able to give me the same solution.
